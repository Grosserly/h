My custom version of [finalboss.org/h/](finalboss.org/h/), (in)complete with different pages and a MowtenDoo reference.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to download `.php` files you don't own, so I can't get the orignal's `text.php`. That means I can't make it generate custom text on the fly.

The main difference between this and the original is that the original had hardcoded `div`s that offset the rainbow background. This version uses JavaScript to generate as many `div`s the browser needs to fit the whole page, even when zoomed out to 25%.

I didn't make [finalboss.org/h/](finalboss.org/h/) pls no sue
