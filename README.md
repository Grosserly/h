# h

My custom version of [finalboss.org/h/](finalboss.org/h/), (in)complete with several special pages and a MowtenDoo reference.

## There are two front-end differences between this and the original:
### Vector graphics
Unfortunately, it is impossible to download `.php` files you don't own, so I can't get the orignal's `text.php`. `text.php` is what enabled the site to make a PNG out of text on the fly, so users could put whatever text they wanted on the site. However, even if I _did_ have it, I wouldn't be able to use it in GitHub Pages because PHP isn't supported here, anyway.
But- this actually turned out to really be a benefit. The fact that I then had to rewrite `text.php`'s functionality caused me to come across a betterâ„¢ solution -- SVG!

The original used raster graphics for the text. When you were to zoom in then, the text would get blurry and have soft edges, as all raster images do. In my version, vector graphics are used instead, leading to three improvements:
1. The vector is smaller than the original's 15x21 PNG
2. Scalable to any size while retaining quality
3. No PHP

### Dynamic div construction
The original had hardcoded `div`s that offset the rainbow background. Since there was always a fixed number of `div`s, there was a limit to how far you could zoom out before the background stopped being diagonal. This version uses JavaScript to generate as many `div`s the browser needs to fit the whole page, even when zoomed out to 25%. This actually reduces file size too. Compared to the original, the code needed to generate `div`s turned out to take up less space.

## TODO
- Fix spacing for long strings sometimes becoming inaccurate
- Fix SVG having margins that shouldn't be there on iOS(?)
