My custom version of [finalboss.org/h/](finalboss.org/h/), (in)complete with different pages and a MowtenDoo reference.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to download `.php` files you don't own, so I can't get the orignal's `text.php`. That means no custom text.

I did not make [finalboss.org/h/](finalboss.org/h/) pls no sue
